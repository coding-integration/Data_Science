# Coding Integration - Math / Science / Data Science

## Part 1 Data Science in Grade 11 Computer Science

### Learning Goals
- A1. demonstrate the ability to use different data types, including one-dimensional arrays, in computer programs.
    - A1.2 desmontrate an understanding of how a computer uses various systems to internally represent data and store information
    - A1.5 describe the structure of one-dimensional arrays and related concepts; including elements, indexes, and bounds
    - A1.6 write programs that declare, inialize, modify, and access one-dimensional arrays.

### Sucess Criteria
- I can use the most appropriate data type to design, implement, and test Python programs.
- I can demonstrate how data is encoded and stored using various systems including binary, hexadecimal, and UNICODE.
